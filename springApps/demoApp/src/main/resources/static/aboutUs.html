<h2>About Cricket</h2>
<p>
    Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in countries like India, England, Australia,
    and South Africa. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, where the objective is to score runs
    while the other team tries to get the players out. The game has multiple formats including
    <strong>Test cricket</strong> (five-day matches), <strong>One Day Internationals (ODIs)</strong>, and
    <strong>T20 cricket</strong>, which is the shortest and most exciting format.
</p>

<p>
    Cricket is known for legendary players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Shane Warne, Brian Lara, Virat Kohli, and
    MS Dhoni. The sport continues to grow globally with tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup and
    franchise leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), which attract players and fans from all over the world.
